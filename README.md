## Usage 

+ To use this package ensure you add the following `using` statement to your project file: 
```csharp 
 using AfricasTalkingCS;
```

The package needs to be configured with your Africa's Talking username and API key (which you can get from the dashboard). 

```csharp  

 const string username = "sandbox"; // substitute with your username if mot using sandbox
 const string apikey = "mySandboxKey"; // substitute with your production API key if not using sandbox

```


```csharp  

 var gateway = new AfricasTalkingGateway(username, apiKey);
  
```
> Important:

 If you register a callback URL with the API, always remember to acknowledge the receipt of any data it sends by responding with an HTTP `200`;  [Here's a sample application you can use to test a call-back url](https://github.com/TheBeachMaster/ATSamples/tree/master/paymentcallback.node) 
> For example in an ASP.NET Core or ASP.NET MVC Project

```csharp 
[HttpPost]
public ActionResult SomeCoolMethod(awesome, params)
{
   // Your awesome logic

   //If not using MVC5
   return new HttpStatusCodeResult(200);

   //If using MVC5
   return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.OK);  // OK = 200
} 
```

### SMS 
```csharp 
            try
            {
                var sms = gateway.SendMessage(recepients, msg);
                foreach (var res in sms["SMSMessageData"]["Recipients"])
                {
                    Console.WriteLine((string)res["number"] + ": ");
                    Console.WriteLine((string)res["status"] + ": ");
                    Console.WriteLine((string)res["messageId"] + ": ");
                    Console.WriteLine((string)res["cost"] + ": ");
                }
            }
            catch (AfricasTalkingGatewayException exception)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(exception);
            }
```

#### [Sending SMS](http://docs.africastalking.com/sms/sending)

    - `options` :   (`Optional`). Passed as _key-value_ pairs 
        -   `enque` : This parameter is used for Bulk SMS clients that would like deliver as many messages to the API before waiting for an Ack from the Telcos. If enabled, the API will store the messages in its databases and send them out asynchronously after responding to the request 
        -   `keyword` : This parameter is used for premium services. It is essential for subscription premium services.
        -   `linkId` : This parameter is used for premium services to send OnDemand messages. We forward the linkId to your application when the user send a message to your service. (Essential for premium subscription services) 
        -   `retryDurationInHours` : This parameter is used for premium messages. It specifies the number of hours your subscription message should be retried in case it's not delivered to the subscriber. (Essential for premium subscription services)

    â€‹

#### [Retrieving SMS](http://docs.africastalking.com/sms/fetchmessages)

> You can register a callback URL with us and we will forward any messages that are sent to your account the moment they arrive. 
> [Read more](http://docs.africastalking.com/sms/callback)

- `FetchMessages(lastReceivedId)` : Manually retrieve your messages.

    - `lastReceivedId` : This is the id of the message that you last processed. If this is your first call, pass in 0. `REQUIRED`


#### [Premium Subscriptions](http://docs.africastalking.com/subscriptions/create)

- `CreateSubscription(phoneNumber,shortCode,keyWord,checkoutToken)`:

                Console.WriteLine("Whoops: " + e.Message);
                throw;
            }
```


### [Voice](http://docs.africastalking.com/voice)  
#### [Call](http://docs.africastalking.com/voice/call) 
- This allows you to push an outbound call to a set of phone numbers and sip addresses.
```csharp 
var callees = "test.user@ke.sip.africastalking.com,+2ABCXXYYYYYY,agent.smith@ug.sip.africastalking.com,neo.theone@ng.sip.africastalking.com";
var callerId = "+2ABaxxyyyyyy";
var clientRequestId = "fieldAgents";
var callAction = gateway.Call(callerId, callees, clientRequestId); 
``` 
- `Call(from, to, clientRequestId)`: 
    - `from`: This is the set caller ID also known as the virtual number provided by Africa's Talking.`REQUIRED`. 
    - `to`: This is a list of destinations to which the call is to be terminated. `REQUIRED`
    -  `clientRequestId`: This is parameter that is set to track the particular outbound call session. The value will be sent to your callback url once the call is complete. `OPTIONAL`; 
```csharp  
            var username = "UserName";
            var apiKey = "APIKEY";
            var from = "virtualNumber";
            var to = "Number";
            var id = "RegionA";

            var gateway = new AfricasTalkingGateway(username, apiKey);

            try
            {
                var results = gateway.Call(from, to, id);
                Console.WriteLine(results);
            }
            catch (AfricasTalkingGatewayException exception)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Something went horribly wrong: " + exception.Message + ".\nCaused by :" + exception.StackTrace);
            }
``` 

##### Important  
Take a look at the voice sample application here [VoiceCallbackSample](https://github.com/AfricasTalkingLtd/africastalking.Net/tree/master/Examples/VoiceApplication)

#### [UploadMediaFile](http://docs.africastalking.com/voice/uploadmedia) 
- This feature alllows you to upload a media file from a known url to our servers. This media file can then be played on demand for example when executing `<Play>` action from your dialplan or `musicOnHold` or `ringBackTone` attributes on a dialplan. 
```csharp 
const string fileLocation = "http(s)://<url>.mp3/wav";
const string phoneNumber = "callerID"; 
var results = gateway.UploadMediaFile(fileLocation, phoneNumber); 
``` 
- `UploadMediaFile(url,  phoneNumber)` : 
    - `url`: A valid web url pointing to the server on which the file is hosted. `REQUIRED`. 
    - `phoneNumber`: A registered virtual number provided by Africa's Talking. `REQUIRED`.

```csharp 
            const string username    = "UserName";
            const string apikey      = "APIKEY";
            const string fileLocation = "http(s)://<url>.mp3||wav";
            const string phoneNumber = "callerID";

            var gateway = new AfricasTalkingGateway(username, apikey);

            try
            {
                var results = gateway.UploadMediaFile(fileLocation, phoneNumber);
                Console.WriteLine(results);
                
            }
            catch (AfricasTalkingGatewayException exception)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Something went horribly wrong: " + exception.Message + ".\nCaused by :" + exception.StackTrace);
            }
```
 
#### [FetchCallQueue](http://docs.africastalking.com/voice/queuedcalls)  
This feature allows you to get number of queued calls from the service. Ideally for this to work you should have a virtual number whose dialplan is set to `<Enqueue>`.  
```csharp 
const string queueNumber = "+2ABCXYYYYYY";
const string queueName = "myQueue";
var results = gateway.GetNumberOfQueuedCalls(queueNumber,queueName); 
``` 
- `GetNumberOfQueuedCalls(phoneNumber, queueName)`: 
    - `phoneNumber`: This is an Africa's Talking virtual number with an `<Enqueue>` dialplan.`REQUIRED`.
    - `queueName`: This is a user defined name assigned to the queue.`OPTIONAL`


### [Airtime](http://docs.africastalking.com/airtime/sending)

```csharp
var airtimeTransaction = gateway.SendAirtime(airtimerecipients);
```
- `SendAirtime(recipients)`: 
    - `recipients`: Contains **JSON objects**  containing the following keys
        - `phoneNumber`: Recipient of airtime
        - `amount`: Amount sent `>= 10 && <= 10K` with currency e.g `KES 100`


```csharp

            class AirtimeUsers {
                    [JsonProperty("phoneNumber")]
                    public string PhoneNumber { get; set; }

                    [JsonProperty("amount")]
                    public string Amount { get; set; }
            }
            const string username = "UserName";
            const string apikey = "MyAPIKEY";
            var airtimeUser = new AirtimeUsers();
            airtimeUser.PhoneNumber = "+2547XXYYYYYY";
            airtimeUser.Amount = "KES 100";
            var airtimeRecipient = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(airtimeUser);
            var gateway = new AfricasTalkingGateway(username, apikey);
            try
            {
                var airtimeTransaction = gateway.SendAirtime(airtimeRecipient);
                Console.WriteLine(airtimeTransaction);
            }
            catch (AfricasTalkingGatewayException e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("We ran into issues: " + e.StackTrace + ": " + e.Message);
            }
```

### [Payments](http://docs.africastalking.com/payments)

> Mobile Consumer To Business (C2B) functionality allows your application to receive payments that are initiated by a mobile subscriber.
> This is typically achieved by disctributing a PayBill or BuyGoods number (and optionally an account number) that clients can use to make payments from their mobile devices.
> [Read more](http://docs.africastalking.com/payments/mobile-c2b)


#### [Checkout](http://docs.africastalking.com/payments/mobile-checkout)

- `Checkout(productName,phoneNumber,currencyCode,amount,providerChannel,metadata)` :  Initiate Customer to Business (C2B) payments on a mobile subscriber's device. [More info](http://docs.africastalking.com/payments/mobile-checkout)

    - `productName`: Your Payment Product. `REQUIRED`

    - `phoneNumber`: The customer phone number (in international format; e.g. `+25471xxxxxxx`). `REQUIRED`

    - `currencyCode`: 3-digit ISO format currency code (e.g `KES`, `USD`, `UGX` etc.) `REQUIRED`

    - `providerChannel`: Default provider channel details.For example `MPESA` or `Athena` for sandbox. 
      - **(Sandbox) :**  Note that for sandbox you'll have to manually create a channel that will be associated with `Athena`. This is the channel name that you will pass as an argument during a checkout.  Example after creating a channel you will have `Athena:channel_name` , pass `channel_name ` as the  _providerChannel_ . 

        â€‹

    - `metadata` : This value contains a map of any metadata that you would like us to associate with this request. You can use this field to send data that will map notifications to checkout requests, since we will include it when we send notifications once the checkout is complete. `(Optional)`

      â€‹

 > Example 
 ```csharp 
            var username = "sandbox";
            var apiKey = "";
            var productName = "coolproduct";
            var phoneNumber = "+254XXXXXXX";
            var currency = "KES";
            int amount = 35700;
            var channel = "mychannel";
    		var metadata = new Dictionary<string, string>
            {
                { "reason", "stuff" }
            };

            var gateway = new AfricasTalkingGateway(username, apiKey);

            try
            {
                // You will get an object of type C2BDataResults :
                // From which you can extract the following properties
                // 1. C2BDataResults.ProviderChannel
                // 2. C2BDataResults.Status
                // 3. C2BDataResults.Description
                // 4. C2BDataResults.TransactionId
                // You also get a ToString() method
                C2BDataResults checkout = gateway.Checkout(productName, phoneNumber, currency, amount, channel, metadata);
                Console.WriteLine(checkout.Status);
            }
            catch (AfricasTalkingGatewayException e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("We ran into problems: " + e.Message);

### [USSD Push](http://docs.africastalking.com/ussd)
> A few things to note about USSD: 

+ USSD is session driven. Every request we send you will contain a sessionId, and this will be maintained until that session is completed
+ **USSD push currently works in Nigeria only**  
+ For this to work properly ensure you have registered a callback URL in your account


```csharp 

            const string Username = "sandbox";
            const string Apikey = "Key";
            var gateway = new AfricasTalkingGateway(Username, Apikey);
            string tokenId = "tkn";
            const string PhoneNumber = "+236XXXXXXXXX";
            const string Menu = "CON You're about to love C#\n1.Accept my fate\n2.No Never\n";

            // Let's create a checkout token  first

### Building a USSD Application 

1. Start by creating a new Web ASP.NET project from any Visual Studio IDE instance  ![Create Application](ScreenShots/ussdapp/CreateApplication.PNG)

2. Select an **Empty**  ASP.NET template and **Ensure you have selected WebAPI** as part of project options ![Select Template](ScreenShots/ussdapp/SelectTemplate.PNG)

3. On your newly created application, navigate to **Solution Explorer** and *right-click* on the *Controllers* folder to add/create a new Controller ![Create Controller](ScreenShots/ussdapp/CreateController.PNG)

4. From the resulting context menu, select **Add>Controller** ![Click to Add Controller](ScreenShots/ussdapp/ClicktoAddController.png)

5. Go ahead and select the **Web API 2 Controller -Empty** Controller template from the Controller scaffold menu ![Select Web API 2 Empty Controller](ScreenShots/ussdapp/SelectWebAPI2EmptyController.PNG) 

6. Rename your Controller ![Name Your Controller](ScreenShots/ussdapp/NameYourController.PNG)

7. Now, in our `USSDServiceController` , go ahead and paste the following code 

   ```c#
   using System;
   using System.Net;
   using System.Net.Http;
   using System.Text;
   using System.Web.Http;

   namespace USSDDemo.Controllers
   {
       [RoutePrefix("application/services")] // Your Application will be served as http(s)://<host>:port/application/services/...
       public class USSDServiceController : ApiController
       {
           [Route("ussdservice")]  // http(s)://<host>:port/application/services/ussdservice
           [HttpPost,ActionName("ussdservice")]

           public HttpResponseMessage httpResponseMessage([FromBody] UssdResponse ussdResponse)
           {
               HttpResponseMessage responseMessage;
               string response;

               if (ussdResponse.text == null)
               {
                   ussdResponse.text = "";
               }

               if (ussdResponse.text.Equals("",StringComparison.Ordinal))
               {
                   response = "CON USSD Demo in Action\n";
                   response += "1. Do something\n";
                   response += "2. Do some other thing\n";
                   response += "3. Get my Number\n";
               }
               else if (ussdResponse.text.Equals("1",StringComparison.Ordinal))
               {
                   response = "END I am doing something \n";
               }else if (ussdResponse.text.Equals("2",StringComparison.Ordinal))
               {
                   response = "END Some other thing has been done \n";
               }else if (ussdResponse.text.Equals("3",StringComparison.Ordinal))
               {
                   response = $"END Here is your phone number : {ussdResponse.phoneNumber} \n";
               }
               else
               {
                   response = "END Invalid option \n";
               }

               responseMessage = Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.Created,response);

               responseMessage.Content = new StringContent(response, Encoding.UTF8, "text/plain");

               return responseMessage;
           }
       }
   }

   ```

   This code basically gives you 3 menus :, you can create more complex logic as you wish, also , as a hack, for deeper level menus use the `*` symbol to separate between levels and sub-levels (menus and submenus). Eg `Level1>Sublevel1>Sub-sublevel1` can be represented as `1*1*1` e.t.c.

   We also have a class `UssdResponse`  as part of our controllers that makes getters and setters for whatever payload we receive from the server. It should look as so:  

   ```c#
   namespace USSDDemo.Controllers
   {
       public class UssdResponse
       {
           public string text { get; set; }
           public string phoneNumber { get; set; }
           public string sessionId { get; set; }
           public string serviceCode { get; set; }

       }
   }
   ```

   To wrap up our project, ensure you have at least  

   ![Project Structure](ScreenShots/ussdapp/ProjectStructure.PNG)

8.  **Build and Run** 

   1. Your application will be served as `http(s)://<host>:port/application/services/ussdservice` 

   2. You can use Postman to test your USSD application as well ![Postman Sample](ScreenShots/ussdapp/PostmanSample.PNG)

      In Postman request body, send `"text":"1"` for example and see the results.
